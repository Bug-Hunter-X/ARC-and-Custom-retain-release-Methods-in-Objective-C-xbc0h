In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods within classes.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
- (void)customRetain;
- (void)customRelease;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)customRetain {
    [self retain]; // Manually increasing the retain count
}

- (void)customRelease {
    [self release]; // Manually decreasing the retain count
}
@end
```

If `customRetain` and `customRelease` are inappropriately used, without careful balance and understanding of ARC's role, it can easily lead to memory leaks or crashes (over-release). ARC is designed to handle memory management automatically, and manual intervention must be exercised with extreme caution.  Manually managing retain counts when ARC is enabled is nearly always incorrect and likely to introduce bugs.
